      collSitu:
      - value: Data collectors conducted one-on-one verbal assessments with each child
          in a quiet, but not secluded, area near tutoring classes (for children attending
          tutoring) or at children’s homes (for children not attending tutoring at
          baseline or who were absent on assessment days). Performance-based measures,
          including EGRA, EGMA, and RACER, were conducted using tablets. All other
          measures were collected via paper-and-pencil forms. Each child assessment
          lasted about 45 minutes to an hour. Each day, data collectors digitized
          the paper-and- pencil survey forms and uploaded the data collected via tablets.
          Children’s demographic and family characteristics were collected at baseline
          through structured interviews with parents or guardians.

      ConOps:
      - value: Following each assessment, enumerators were required to complete tracking
          sheets to provide a physical record of which student(s) were assessed, when,
          and by whom. Enumerators reported any known aberrant entries — such as incorrect
          student IDs, student substitutions, or assessment issues — to the Research
          Officers, who supervised a team of 20 enumerators each. After each day of
          data collection, each Research Officer aggregated enumerator tracking sheets
          and checked each field-reported assessment against the assessments that
          had been uploaded to the servers. Any inconsistencies between tracking sheets
          and the data uploads were investigated with enumerators and reported to
          IRC’s senior research officers, who recorded any data entry errors and problems
          as well as corrected data entries. For the RACER data, automated scans were
          run regularly during the data collection period to detect any discrepancies
          between the data collected and the tracking sheet. The generated error cases
          were also communicated back to the senior research officer who tracks all
          the changes that needed to be made in the final dataset.

      - value: All 87 research sites were retained for the implementation period and
          included in the analytic sample. At the student level, all children who
          had any student-level data collected at either Time 1 or Time 2 were retained
          as the ITT and analytic sample, excluding 5% (n = 186) students missing
          data in both waves (PS = 1%; PS+HCT = 5%; PS+HCT+Mind = 4%). Of the students
          included in the final sample, 5% were missing from Time 1 data but had Time
          2 data. As might be expected with a highly mobile population in a crisis
          context, 23% were missing all data at Time 2. Specifically, missing data
          among children in the public school only condition was relatively low (6%),
          largely due to the fact that data collectors went door-to-door to administer
          assessments in home settings. In contrast, 26% were missing all data at
          Time 2 in each of the two treatment conditions. Assessments were largely
          administered in the treatment conditions during the remedial classroom sessions;
          and when absent children were not assessed due to limited resources and
          time.

      collectorTraining:
      - value: Trainings for data collectors were led by IRC M&E and Research managers,
          with extensive support from research officers. The training lasted for a
          total of five days. Prior to initiating the fieldwork, the data surveyors
          received a thorough training on the measures to administer and the tools
          to use. The baseline training lasted for seven days, and was later reduced
          to five days in the Midline and Endline, based on feedback from the surveyors
          and Research Officers. Training in the administration of each measure began
          with an introduction to the structure of the tool, a description of the
          skills being assessed, and the rules for administering the assessment. It
          was followed by staff demonstrations and role plays by volunteer enumerators.
          When enumerators demonstrated mastery of the content in whole-group, they
          transitioned to paired practice for fluency. Translations from written to
          spoken Arabic were discussed and agreed upon by the group. IRC and NYU team
          members from the two locations debriefed each night to ensure consistency
          between the two regions.
